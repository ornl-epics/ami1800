# AMI1800
EPICS Driver developed by Mariano Ruiz, zma@ornl.gov

The AMI1800 is a He and N level meter developed by American Cryomagnetics. 
American Magnetics, Inc. Model 1800 Instrument
Remote Interface Model 1800 Instrument RS-232 and 
Ethernet interfaces. 


The EPICS driver communicates directly using TCP/IP basic Text ASCII SCPI format. 
POe sensor using DHCP. The AMI1800 is used for the LHeAF Liquid He AutoFill System.

The two most common cryogenic liquids used in superconducting magnet 
systems are nitrogen and helium. Both of these cryogens are extremely 
cold at atmospheric pressure (321°F and 452°F, respectively). The 
following paragraphs outline safe handling precautions for these liquids.
